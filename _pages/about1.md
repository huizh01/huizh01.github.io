### More about me...
I have been learning accordion music for several years, and it has been quite a long time since I played it last time. I like all kinds of water sports. As an amateur swimmer, I participated in municipal competitions in high school. When I was studying in Hong Kong, I played windsurfing and sailing on summer weekends, and I got licenses for both of them. I have also obtained a PADI scuba diving license and expect to go diving in Sipadan in the near future. Recently, I fell in love with skiing, hoping to improve my skiing skills and go to the Alps with my friends. In my spare time, I like to cook, grow flowers and plants and decorate the room. I also like to go outdoors on weekends, where I can embrace nature and appreciate the beauty of the world.
