# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.hku.hk) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk), advised by Prof. [Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping). [[Curriculum Vitae](http://huizh.com/files/huizh_cv.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9TdxN0MAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)]
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.
* I received my Master’s Degree in [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn). My Master research advisor is Prof. [Shuang Cong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=2oPsqNQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).
