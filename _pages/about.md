# About Me
* I am a final year Ph.D. student of Computer Graphics Group, in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk), advised by Prof. [Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping). 
I also worked with Prof. [Thomas Ertl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qFQ9jHkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Daniel Weiskopf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sclEgM4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at [Visualization Research Centre](https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de/en), University of Stuttgart, and Dr. [Nobuyuki Umetani](http://www.nobuyuki-umetani.com) and Prof. [Takeo Igarashi](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/index.html) at [HCI for Machine Learning Lab](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/crest/members.html), The University of Tokyo. 
Before this I received M.S. degree in the [Department of Automation](https://auto.ustc.edu.cn/en/index.php), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Shuang Cong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=2oPsqNQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works), and previously B.E.degree in School of Information Science and Engineering, Southwest University of Science and Technology, China.
